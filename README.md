The last one is dedicated to provide you the box plot for categorical variables. It is not difficult for you to understand how this application works. But, please read "4. How to use" before you use this.

## 4. How to use
For each tab for graphs, you will need to select several options in the left panel. You need to select a variable to be shown as x-axis. Then, you need to select a variable to be shown as y-axis.
